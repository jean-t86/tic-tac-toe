## Description

This project is from JetBrains' Academy Kotlin's track. It is a console application that implements a game
of Tic-Tac-Toe. The project is divided in 5 different stages, which will be described briefly.

## General Information

>Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs 
and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the 
best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, 
using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

## Technologies 
- Kotlin
- IntelliJ IDEA
